5. In remotely-save setting page, input the address / bucket / access key / secret key. **Usually minio instances may need "S3 URL style"="Path Style".** Enable "Bypass CORS", because usually that's what you want.

## Ports In Address

Just type in the full address with `http(s)://` and `:port` in remotely-save settings, for example `http://192.168.31.198:9000`.

It's verified that everything is ok.
