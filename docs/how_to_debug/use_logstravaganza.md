# Use `Logstravaganza`

On iOS, it's quite hard to directly check the console logs.

Luckily, there is a third-party plugin: [`Logstravaganza`](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Logstravaganza#), by Carlo Zottmann, that can redirect the output to a note.

You can just:

1. Install it.
2. Enable it.
3. Do something, to trigger some console logs.
4. Checkout `LOGGING-NOTE (device name).md` in the root of your vault.
